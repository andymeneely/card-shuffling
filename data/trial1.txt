# Trial 1
# Collected April 13th, 2011
# Started with a deck Ace, 2, 3, ..., King. Clubs, then Diamonds, Hearts, Spades. 
# Each "Rifle" represents shuffling the deck as it was, then capturing the order
# So for example, Rifle 21 means the deck has been shuffled 21 times since the original rifle shuffle.
# The photos are ordered with the top card being upper left. Then going down, and then left to right.
